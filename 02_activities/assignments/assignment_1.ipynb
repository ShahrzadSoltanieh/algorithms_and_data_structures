    "The solution works by using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the binary tree level by level from the root. This approach ensures that if a duplicate exists, it will be found at the closest level to the root. BFS guarantees that the first duplicate encountered is the closest because it processes nodes level by level. A set tracks node values to identify duplicates as they are encountered, allowing for quick detection. The 'deque' from 'collections' is used for efficient queue operations, which is crucial for maintaining BFS performance. If a duplicate is found, it is returned immediately, if no duplicates are found by the end of the traversal, the function returns -1.\n",
